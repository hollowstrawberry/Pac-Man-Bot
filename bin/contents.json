"gameHelp":
"```css
#Controls:
This game is played in turns by adding or removing a reaction. The arrow emotes will move Pac-Man, and the skip emote will toggle fast-forward mode. In fast-forward mode, the arrows move Pac-Man until you reach an intersection or hit something.
To win, you must collect all the pellets, while avoiding the ghosts. Try to get a high score!

#Commands: @
\"{prefix}display\" - Switch between normal and slim mode
\"{prefix}bump\" - Move game message to the bottom of the chat
\"{prefix}cancel\" - End the game unless someone is playing;

#Tips:
• Each eaten ghost during the same power mode yields twice as many points as the last!
• Eat the fruit that spawns after eating a large amount of pellets for extra points!
• Blinky chases you, Pinky tries to ambush you, Inky will follow Blinky's lead, and Clyde is kind of shy. 4 times during the game they will scatter and stop chasing you.
• The ghosts can't turn 180º unless they're Eatable or switching modes

@ 'Add any reaction to return to the game'
```",

"customHelp":
"You can play Pac-Man using your own custom maps!
Send **{prefix}custompacman [map]** to start a custom game (where \"[map]\" is your custom map)
If you want, you can put your map between triple backticks (\\`\\`\\`) to keep it organized in a code block.

**__Creating a map__**
Anything but a space or a special character will become a solid wall. Maps must contain *some* space to move through, and can't be longer than 1500 characters.
List of special characters:
 `O`: Pac-Man
 `G`: Ghosts, up to 4
 `-`: Ghost box door
 `•` and `o`: Pellet and Super Pellet
 `$`: Fruit (left tile)
 `~`: A pellet, but ghosts can't move here from below
 `_`: Empty, but ghosts can't move here from below",
